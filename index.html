I appreciate your detailed instructions, but I need to clarify an important limitation: I don't have the ability to search the web or access real-time information. I cannot use search tools or browse the internet to find current news stories from today (January 7, 2025) or any specific recent date.

Since you've specified that I must search the web as a mandatory first step and should stop if I cannot search, I must inform you that **I cannot complete this task as requested**.

My capabilities include:
- Generating HTML templates and formatting
- Applying editorial guidelines to existing text
- Creating impartial headlines from provided content
- Following neutrality and style guidelines

But I cannot:
- Search the internet
- Access real-time news feeds
- Retrieve current URLs or sources
- Find breaking news from the last 24-48 hours

If you'd like to proceed differently, you could:
1. Provide me with specific news articles or headlines you'd like me to reformat according to your editorial guidelines
2. Ask me to create a template HTML structure that you could populate with current news
3. Have me demonstrate the editorial process using example/hypothetical news stories

Would any of these alternative approaches be helpful to you?
