I apologize, but I cannot complete this task as requested. I don't have the ability to search the web or access real-time information, including current news from January 7, 2026, or any other date. 

My knowledge has a training cutoff date, and I cannot:
- Search the internet for current news
- Access live news websites
- Retrieve real URLs or current sources
- Verify breaking news stories
- Access information beyond my training data

Since your mandatory first step requires web searching capabilities that I don't possess, I must stop here and inform you that I cannot complete this task.

If you'd like to proceed with this type of news aggregation project, you would need to either:
1. Use a tool or service that has web search capabilities
2. Provide me with specific news articles and sources that you've already found
3. Modify the task to work with information I can access from my training data

Would you like to adjust the approach, or is there another way I can help you with a news-related project?
