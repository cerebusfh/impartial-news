I cannot complete this task as requested. I don't have the ability to search the web or access real-time information, including current news stories, live URLs, or today's date (January 7, 2026).

My training data has a knowledge cutoff, and I cannot:
- Perform web searches using search tools
- Access current breaking news
- Retrieve real URLs or sources
- Know what today's actual date is
- Access information about events from the last 24-48 hours

To complete this news aggregation task, you would need to use a tool or service that has:
- Real-time web search capabilities
- Access to current news APIs
- Live data feeds from news sources

If you'd like, I could help you create a template HTML structure for a news site, or show you how to format news stories according to the impartial editorial guidelines you outlined, but I cannot provide actual current news content.
