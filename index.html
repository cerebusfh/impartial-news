I understand you want me to search for current news and create an HTML news page, but I need to clarify an important limitation: I cannot actually search the web or access real-time information. I don't have the ability to browse the internet, access current news websites, or retrieve live data from news sources.

**I cannot complete this task because:**

1. I cannot perform web searches using search tools
2. I cannot access current news websites or their URLs
3. I cannot retrieve real-time information from the last 24-48 hours
4. I don't have access to breaking news from January 7, 2026 (or any current date)

**What I could do instead:**

If you'd like, I could:
- Create a template HTML page showing the format you want
- Create a mock news page with example headlines showing how the editorial guidelines would be applied
- Help you write guidelines for someone else who does have web access to create this news aggregator

Would any of these alternatives be helpful, or would you prefer to have someone with actual web search capabilities complete this task?
