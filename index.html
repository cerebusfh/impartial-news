                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;Pope Leo XIV delivered a heartfelt appeal for peace during his weekly Angelus prayer on Sunday, January 11, 2026, specifically focusing on the escalating violence in Iran and the ongoing conflict in Syria. The Pope offered prayers for those killed in widespread protests that have swept across Iran since December 28, 2025, as well as for victims of Syria's continuing turmoil. His remarks came amid a deadly government crackdown in Iran that has resulted in hundreds of casualties, with human rights groups reporting at least 65-217 deaths in recent days, though exact figures remain unclear due to an internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities.\n\nThe pontiff's call for dialogue and peace represents a continuation of his consistent advocacy for global stability throughout his papacy. Pope Leo XIV has regularly used his Sunday Angelus addresses to pray for regions affected by conflict, including Ukraine, the Middle East, and various African nations experiencing violence. His appeal coincided with mounting international concern over Iran's violent response to protesters who initially took to the streets over economic hardships but whose demands have since broadened to include calls for regime change.\n\nThe timing of the Pope's intervention is particularly significant as protests in Iran have spread to all 31 provinces, with demonstrators facing live ammunition and mass arrests. Iranian authorities have imposed severe internet restrictions and declared protesters 'enemies of God,' carrying potential death penalty charges. The Pope's words echo broader international calls for restraint, including warnings from the United States and condemnation from human rights organizations who describe the current situation as reminiscent of previous deadly crackdowns on Iranian civil society.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;Free Malaysia Today&quot;,&quot;The Korea Times&quot;,&quot;BSS News&quot;,&quot;ASHARQ AL-AWSAT&quot;,&quot;Iran International&quot;,&quot;TIME Magazine&quot;,&quot;CNN&quot;,&quot;Amnesty International&quot;,&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;2025-2026 Iranian protests&quot;,&quot;Middle East conflicts&quot;,&quot;Vatican diplomatic appeals&quot;,&quot;Syria humanitarian crisis&quot;,&quot;Internet censorship in authoritarian regimes&quot;]}'>

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;The Treasury Department's Venezuela operations strategy represents a significant shift in U.S. policy following the military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on January 3, 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that additional sanctions on Venezuela could be lifted as soon as this week, with scheduled meetings between Treasury officials and the heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. These discussions focus on accessing nearly $5 billion in frozen Venezuelan Special Drawing Rights held at the IMF, which could be converted to dollars for Venezuela's reconstruction. The sanctions review comes as part of a broader Trump administration effort to stabilize Venezuela's post-Maduro transition and encourage U.S. oil sector investment. The administration is working through Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who has offered cooperation with U.S. officials \&quot;within the framework of international law.\&quot; International financial institutions, including the IMF and World Bank, have already reached out to U.S. officials about Venezuela engagement, with the World Bank exploring early-stage assistance similar to its rapid response in Afghanistan and Syria after regime changes. The Treasury's approach involves analyzing how sanctions relief can facilitate government operations and reconstruction while addressing the complex $150 billion debt restructuring that creditors view as essential for private capital return to Venezuela.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;Fox Business&quot;,&quot;CNBC&quot;,&quot;U.S. News & World Report&quot;,&quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;,&quot;U.S. Treasury Department&quot;,&quot;Reuters&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;Venezuela debt restructuring negotiations&quot;,&quot;IMF Special Drawing Rights utilization&quot;,&quot;Post-regime change international assistance frameworks&quot;,&quot;U.S. oil sector investment in Latin America&quot;,&quot;Treasury sanctions policy coordination with multilateral institutions&quot;]}'>

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;The small-cap stock rally that began in late 2025 has continued into early 2026, with the Russell 2000 Index reaching all-time highs above 2,600 as investors rotate capital away from large-cap technology stocks. The rally has been fueled by multiple factors including the Federal Reserve's monetary easing policy, which lowered the federal funds rate to 3.50-3.75% through three consecutive quarter-point cuts. This reduced borrowing costs particularly benefit smaller companies that rely heavily on floating-rate debt, improving their cash flow and enabling investment and refinancing activities.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, small-cap stocks remain attractively priced relative to their large-cap peers. As of January 2026, the Russell 2000 trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 18, significantly below the S&P 500's valuation near 22x. This discount has attracted value-oriented investors as capital rotates out of richly valued mega-cap stocks. Additionally, earnings growth projections for small-cap companies are particularly robust, with consensus estimates forecasting 17-22% growth for 2026, substantially outpacing the 14% growth expected for the S&P 500.\n\nThe broader market rotation reflects what analysts are calling the 'Great Rotation' - a shift from narrow, technology-led leadership to more inclusive market participation. This trend suggests the market is moving toward a more balanced state where fundamental valuations and earnings growth, rather than momentum alone, drive stock performance. The rotation has been further supported by seasonal patterns, with historical data showing that small-cap gains in late December and January often continue through mid-February. Market breadth expansion and the end of the concentrated 'Magnificent Seven' dominance signal a potentially healthier and more resilient bull market environment.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;Bank of America Private Bank&quot;,&quot;Goldman Sachs&quot;,&quot;Barchart/Moore Research Center&quot;,&quot;LSEG/FTSE Russell&quot;,&quot;ProShares&quot;,&quot;Financial Content/Market Minute&quot;,&quot;Yahoo Finance&quot;,&quot;The Street&quot;,&quot;American Century Investments&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;Federal Reserve monetary policy&quot;,&quot;January Effect seasonality&quot;,&quot;Market breadth expansion&quot;,&quot;Technology sector rotation&quot;,&quot;Earnings growth projections&quot;,&quot;Interest rate sensitivity&quot;,&quot;Valuation discounts&quot;,&quot;Small-cap ETF performance&quot;]}'>

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;The diplomatic meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister and Japanese Foreign Minister on January 11, 2026, in Jerusalem represents a significant milestone in strengthening bilateral relations between the two nations. This meeting comes as part of the Japanese Foreign Minister's comprehensive nine-day tour of the Middle East and Asia, marking Israel as one of his key diplomatic destinations during a period of regional tension.\n\nThis high-level diplomatic engagement follows unprecedented parliamentary diplomacy, with the largest-ever delegation of 15 Japanese lawmakers visiting Israel just days before the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The parliamentary delegation toured southern Israel, including the Nova music festival massacre site, and met with senior Israeli officials, demonstrating Japan's commitment to understanding Israel's security challenges firsthand.\n\nThe meeting occurs against the backdrop of Japan's balanced diplomatic approach in the Middle East. Japan has maintained what Israel views as a supportive stance, refraining from joining other G7 countries in recognizing a Palestinian state despite international pressure, while also sanctioning Israeli settlers and criticizing settlement expansion in the West Bank. The discussions likely covered regional security cooperation, Gaza reconstruction efforts, and the broader Middle East peace process, with the Japanese Foreign Minister expected to visit the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center overseeing ceasefire and humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nThis diplomatic engagement reflects the warming of Japan-Israel relations under Japan's current government, continuing the diplomatic legacy established by previous administrations. The relationship extends beyond politics to include robust cooperation in technology, innovation, and cultural exchanges, with Japan's participation in international events like the Osaka Expo drawing significant Israeli interest and over 1.8 million visitors to the Israeli pavilion.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;Ynet News&quot;,&quot;Japan Today&quot;,&quot;Adnkronos English&quot;,&quot;Anadolu Agency&quot;,&quot;Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs&quot;,&quot;Nippon.com&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;Japan-Israel Strategic Partnership&quot;,&quot;Middle East Peace Process&quot;,&quot;Gaza Ceasefire and Reconstruction&quot;,&quot;G7 Diplomatic Coordination&quot;,&quot;Parliamentary Diplomacy&quot;,&quot;Regional Security Cooperation&quot;]}'>

The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed that Moon was killed in an accidental traffic collision Thursday morning, with traumatic injuries listed as the cause of death. Moon's death has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with colleagues and fans mourning the loss of a prolific composer who helped define the sound of childhood for an entire generation.\n\nMoon's career spanned over four decades and included more than 70 composing credits across film, television, and animated series. He was perhaps most famous for his four-time Emmy-nominated work on 'The Fairly OddParents,' where he composed the theme song and provided scores for over 200 episodes during the show's full 10-season run from 2001-2017. His work earned him an Annie Award in 2010 for Music in a Television Production. Beyond 'The Fairly OddParents,' Moon created memorable scores for other Nickelodeon series including 'Danny Phantom,' 'Big Time Rush,' 'T.U.F.F. Puppy,' and 'Back at the Barnyard,' as well as Cartoon Network shows like 'Johnny Bravo' and 'Cow and Chicken.'\n\nBorn February 7, 1962, in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, Moon attended the University of Arizona before moving to California in 1986 to pursue his music career. His versatility extended beyond television to film composing, including work on 'The Brady Bunch Movie,' 'A Very Brady Sequel,' and the three live-action 'Fairly OddParents' movies, as well as soundtrack contributions to major films like 'Minority Report,' 'Fight Club,' and 'Mystic Pizza.' His family described him as a beloved patriarch who 'has left an unmistakable legacy' and are planning memorial celebrations on his birthday, February 7, in Los Angeles and later in his Wisconsin hometown.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;,&quot;NBC Los Angeles&quot;,&quot;Newsweek&quot;,&quot;Yahoo News&quot;,&quot;BNO News&quot;,&quot;NickALive!&quot;,&quot;mxdwn Television&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;Emmy nominations for Outstanding Music and Lyrics category&quot;,&quot;Annie Awards for animated television music&quot;,&quot;Nickelodeon animated series composers&quot;,&quot;Butch Hartman collaborations&quot;,&quot;Traffic safety in Los Angeles entertainment industry&quot;,&quot;Legacy of 2000s Nickelodeon theme songs&quot;]}'>
