I understand your request for creating an impartial news aggregation page, but I need to clarify an important limitation: I don't have the ability to search the web or access real-time information. I cannot browse the internet, search for current news, or access URLs to gather the breaking news stories you've requested.

Since your mandatory first step requires me to search the web for current news from January 7, 2026, and verify real sources with URLs, I cannot complete this task as specified.

If you'd like to proceed with this project, you could:

1. **Provide me with recent news articles** - You could search for and provide me with current news stories, and I'll help you create the impartial HTML news page using your editorial guidelines

2. **Use this as a template** - I could create a sample HTML template with placeholder content that demonstrates the structure and formatting you want

3. **Focus on the editorial process** - I could help you refine the editorial guidelines and demonstrate how to transform biased headlines into impartial ones using example stories

Would any of these alternatives be helpful for your project?
