I understand your request, but I need to inform you that I cannot complete this task as specified. I do not have the ability to search the web or access real-time information, including current news from January 7, 2026 or any other date.

My limitations include:
- No web browsing capability
- No access to real-time news feeds or current events
- No ability to retrieve URLs or verify current sources
- My knowledge has a training cutoff and I cannot access information beyond that point

To complete the news aggregation task you've outlined, you would need to use:
1. A web search engine or news API
2. Real-time news aggregation services
3. Direct access to news websites
4. Tools that can browse the internet and retrieve current content

If you have access to current news sources and would like me to help format that information into the HTML structure you've specified, or if you'd like me to create a template that you could populate with real news data, I'd be happy to assist with that instead.
