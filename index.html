I understand you want me to search for current news and create an HTML news page. However, I need to clarify an important limitation: I don't have the ability to search the web or access real-time information. I cannot use search tools or browse the internet to find current news stories from today (January 7, 2026, or any current date).

**I cannot complete this task as requested** because:

1. I don't have web search capabilities
2. I cannot access current news sources or URLs
3. I cannot verify real sources with current information
4. My training data has a cutoff date and doesn't include real-time information

If you'd like me to help you with this task, I could:
- Create a template HTML structure that you could populate with real news stories
- Show you how to format news stories using the editorial guidelines you provided
- Demonstrate the neutrality and impartiality principles on sample/hypothetical stories

But I cannot search for and generate actual current news content as that would require real-time web access that I don't possess.

Would you like me to help in one of these alternative ways instead?
