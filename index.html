I understand your request for creating a news aggregation page, but I need to inform you that I cannot complete this task as specified. 

**I cannot search the web or access current news sources.** I don't have the ability to use search tools or browse the internet to find real-time news stories, URLs, or current events from January 7, 2026 (or any current date).

Since you've made it mandatory that I must search the web first and verify real sources with URLs before proceeding, and I cannot perform this essential first step, I must stop here rather than generate fictional news content.

If you'd like to proceed with this project, you could:

1. **Provide me with recent news articles** that you've found, and I can help rewrite them according to your editorial guidelines
2. **Use a different approach** where I create a template HTML structure that you could populate with real news
3. **Modify the task** to focus on the editorial guidelines and HTML structure rather than requiring real-time news gathering

Would any of these alternatives work for your needs?
