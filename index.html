I'm unable to perform web searches in real-time or access current news articles. Therefore, I can't gather or verify news from the web that is as recent as January 7, 2026, or any other specific date beyond my last training, which included data up to October 2023.

If you have specific articles or information you'd like to share, I can help format the content you've provided into the specified HTML template. Let me know how you would like to proceed!
