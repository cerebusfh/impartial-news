The court indicated its next opinion day would come Wednesday, Jan. 14.</cite>\n\nThe case centers on <cite index=\&quot;6-11,6-12\&quot;>Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \&quot;reciprocal\&quot; tariffs on goods imported from individual countries – nearly every foreign trading partner – to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.</cite> <cite index=\&quot;11-4,11-10,11-13\&quot;>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and others referenced IEEPA's purpose and legislative history, noting that Congress enacted the statute in 1977 to narrow presidential authority that had been broadly exercised under TWEA. The Supreme Court justices repeatedly pressed the U.S. government, represented by the solicitor general, to identify explicit statutory language in IEEPA that authorizes the president to impose tariffs. Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Chief Justice John Roberts both emphasized that tariffs generate revenue from American citizens and thus implicate Congress' core taxing authority rather than a mere regulatory function.</cite>\n\nThe financial stakes are substantial. <cite index=\&quot;21-1,21-3\&quot;>On December 15, U.S. Customs announced $200 billion had been collected in new tariffs imposed by President Trump during his second term.</cite> <cite index=\&quot;24-6,24-7,24-8\&quot;>US Treasury Scott Bessent told Reuters that the US Treasury has more than enough funds to cover any tariff refunds that could be ordered by the Supreme Court in the upcoming ruling. The treasury reportedly has nearly $774 billion in cash on hand. However, the payments would be spread out over weeks or even a year.</cite> <cite index=\&quot;4-32\&quot;>Whatever the decision, the case is being closely watched, as companies like Costco (COST) bring lawsuits against the US government in the hope of securing a refund on import duties if the court rejects Trump's authority to impose tariffs.</cite> <cite index=\&quot;25-17,25-3\&quot;>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \&quot;mishmash\&quot; ruling.

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;U.S. stock markets surged to record highs on Friday, January 10, 2026, capping off a strong first full trading week of the new year. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to close at an all-time high of 6,964.87, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained approximately 0.5% (around 260 points) to reach 49,526, also posting a new record. The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.8% as semiconductor stocks rallied sharply, with all three major indices securing winning weeks with gains of at least 1%.\n\nThe record-setting session came after the December jobs report showed mixed results that solidified expectations for Federal Reserve policy. The report revealed that the U.S. economy added only 50,000 jobs in December, below economists' expectations of 70,000, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to 4.4% from 4.5%. This weaker-than-expected job growth increased trader confidence that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady at its January 27-28 meeting, with CME FedWatch showing a 97% probability of no rate cuts, up from 88% the previous day.\n\nSemiconductor stocks were standout performers, driving much of the market's gains. Notable winners included Intel (up 10.8%), Lam Research (up 8.7%), and Broadcom (up 3.8%), reflecting continued investor optimism about artificial intelligence and semiconductor growth. Housing-related stocks also surged after President Trump announced plans to direct $200 billion in mortgage bond purchases aimed at lowering housing costs, with homebuilders like D.R. Horton gaining 7.8% and Lennar rising 8.8%.\n\nThe strong performance represents a continuation of the market's momentum from 2025, when the S&P 500 gained over 16% for the year, marking the third consecutive year of double-digit gains for major indices. Market analysts note that despite ongoing concerns about high valuations and geopolitical tensions, investor sentiment remains buoyed by expectations of business-friendly policies and continued artificial intelligence investment.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;Yahoo Finance&quot;,&quot;Trading Economics&quot;,&quot;GV Wire&quot;,&quot;CNBC&quot;,&quot;The Street&quot;,&quot;Seeking Alpha&quot;,&quot;Nasdaq.com&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;Federal Reserve Interest Rate Policy&quot;,&quot;December Employment Report&quot;,&quot;Semiconductor Stock Rally&quot;,&quot;AI and Technology Sector Performance&quot;,&quot;Housing Market and Mortgage Policy&quot;,&quot;2026 Market Outlook&quot;,&quot;Geopolitical Impact on Markets&quot;]}'>

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;The fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on January 7, 2026, occurred during what federal authorities described as the largest immigration enforcement operation ever conducted, involving 2,000 agents deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and mother of three, was shot three times in the head while sitting in her Honda Pilot on Portland Avenue after agents approached her vehicle and gave what witnesses described as conflicting orders. Video evidence analyzed frame-by-frame shows Good turning her steering wheel away from the agent just over one second before Ross fired the first shot, contradicting federal claims that she attempted to ram officers with her vehicle.\n\nThe FBI assumed sole control of the investigation after initially agreeing to work jointly with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). This decision sparked significant controversy, with state officials arguing they were denied access to crucial evidence including the victim's vehicle, witness interviews, and scene materials. The governor and local leaders have demanded federal authorities include state investigators, emphasizing the BCA's established expertise in use-of-force investigations since its creation following the George Floyd case.\n\nGood, described as a poet, writer, and devoted Christian, had recently moved to Minneapolis from Kansas City with her wife and 6-year-old son. Family members stated she was not an activist but was acting as a legal observer of ICE activities when the shooting occurred. The incident has sparked massive protests throughout Minneapolis, with thousands gathering for vigils and demonstrations. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey directly challenged federal narratives, stating after viewing video evidence that claims of self-defense were false and demanding ICE leave the city.\n\nThe shooting represents the ninth time ICE agents have opened fire since September 2025, with four other deaths during federal deportation operations. Multiple videos of the incident have circulated, including footage apparently taken by Ross himself showing Good saying she wasn't angry before being killed. The case has intensified debates over federal immigration enforcement tactics and local-federal cooperation in criminal investigations.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;CBS News Minnesota&quot;,&quot;ABC News&quot;,&quot;Star Tribune&quot;,&quot;NBC News&quot;,&quot;Newsweek&quot;,&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;,&quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;,&quot;Minnesota Department of Public Safety&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;Federal-state jurisdiction disputes in criminal investigations&quot;,&quot;ICE enforcement operations and use of deadly force&quot;,&quot;Minneapolis civil unrest and police accountability&quot;,&quot;Immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities&quot;,&quot;Legal observer rights during federal operations&quot;]}'>

The 26-year-old from Plano, Texas, scored a total of 233.55 points, with her free skate program earning a season-best 150.50 points. Her signature opening triple axel – the only 3½-revolution jump attempted by any medal contender – set the tone for a flawless routine that brought the Enterprise Center crowd to its feet.\n\nCompeting in an exceptionally strong field, Glenn edged out reigning world champion Alysa Liu, who finished second with 228.91 points, and Isabeau Levito, who claimed bronze with 224.45 points. Liu, known for her viral halo-dyed hair and Lady Gaga-themed free skate, was notably supportive of Glenn's victory despite being pushed to silver. Glenn had earlier set a U.S. championships record in the short program with 83.05 points, giving her a crucial lead heading into Friday's free skate.\n\nThis victory virtually secures Glenn's spot on the 2026 U.S. Olympic team for the Milan Cortina Games, alongside Liu and Levito. The trio represents America's strongest women's figure skating contingent in years, with hopes of ending a medal drought that dates back to 2006. Glenn admitted to pre-competition nerves, saying she felt like she was \&quot;going to throw up,\&quot; but credited her experience and \&quot;fake it 'till you make it\&quot; mentality for helping her deliver under pressure.

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;Sony Interactive Entertainment officially announced the PlayStation Plus Essential monthly games for January 2026 on December 31, 2025. The lineup consists of Need for Speed Unbound (PS5 exclusive), Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (PS4 and PS5), and Core Keeper (PS4 and PS5). These titles become available to PlayStation Plus subscribers on January 6, 2026, and remain claimable until February 2, 2026. This marks a significant shift for the service, as January 2026 represents the first month where Sony is no longer guaranteeing PS4-exclusive games, focusing primarily on PS5 titles and cross-generation releases.\n\nThe January 2026 lineup targets three distinct gaming audiences. Need for Speed Unbound, Criterion Games' return to the franchise after a decade-long hiatus, offers arcade racing with unique visual flair described as 'comic book-like' by reviewers. The game earned a 75 Top Critic Average on OpenCritic and features both day and night racing mechanics. Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed represents a modern remake of the 2010 Wii classic, receiving a warmer critical reception than its predecessor with a 77 Top Critic Average. The game appeals to platformer fans and family audiences with its paint-and-thinner mechanics and Disney nostalgia. Core Keeper stands out as the most critically acclaimed title, earning an 87 Top Critic Average. This 1-8 player sandbox adventure game combines elements of Terraria and Stardew Valley, offering mining, crafting, and cooperative gameplay.\n\nSubscriber reaction to the January 2026 lineup has been mixed, with some expressing disappointment after PlayStation Plus's strong 2025 performance, which included major titles like Alan Wake 2, Psychonauts 2, and Lies of P. Industry observers note this transition period as PlayStation Plus moves away from PS4 support, potentially affecting the total number of monthly offerings. The service continues to compete with Xbox Game Pass by expanding its Extra and Premium tier catalogs, though the Essential tier remains the primary subscription service for online multiplayer access.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;PlayStation.Blog&quot;,&quot;NeoGAF&quot;,&quot;ResetEra&quot;,&quot;IBTimes UK&quot;,&quot;NME&quot;,&quot;Game Rant&quot;,&quot;PSNProfiles&quot;,&quot;Slickdeals&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;PlayStation Plus service evolution and PS4 phase-out&quot;,&quot;January 2026 gaming subscription competition with Xbox Game Pass&quot;,&quot;Need for Speed franchise return under Criterion Games development&quot;]}'>

                <article class="news-story" data-expansion='{&quot;expanded_summary&quot;:&quot;Nvidia's GeForce NOW cloud gaming service has launched its 2026 lineup with significant upgrades, adding 14 new games throughout January. The platform's marquee enhancement comes from the integration of RTX 5080-powered servers, marking what the company calls the biggest cloud gaming upgrade ever. The RTX 5080 servers feature DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation technology that enables streaming at up to 5K resolution at 120 frames per second, with response times as low as 30 milliseconds. This represents a major performance boost over the previous RTX 4080 hardware, offering up to 2.8x faster frame rates.\n\nThe January game additions include both new releases and expanded platform support. Five titles are available immediately: My Winter Car, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, The Casting of Frank Stone, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and Eternights. The remaining nine games will roll out throughout the month, including StarRupture (January 6), Pathologic 3 (January 9), and MIO: Memories in Orbit (January 20). Many titles are available through Game Pass integration, expanding accessibility for subscribers.\n\nThe platform has also introduced the Install-to-Play feature, which nearly doubles the game library to over 4,500 titles. Ultimate subscribers receive 100GB of cloud storage, with expansion options available. Despite these substantial upgrades, GeForce NOW Ultimate pricing remains unchanged at $19.99 per month, though new usage limits of 100 hours per month have been implemented for all subscription tiers, requiring additional fees for extended play sessions.&quot;,&quot;additional_sources&quot;:[&quot;WccfTech&quot;,&quot;Neowin&quot;,&quot;Tom's Guide&quot;,&quot;The Shortcut&quot;,&quot;Gaming Amigos&quot;],&quot;related_topics&quot;:[&quot;NVIDIA Blackwell RTX architecture integration&quot;,&quot;Cloud gaming performance benchmarks vs PlayStation 5 Pro&quot;,&quot;Install-to-Play feature expanding game library to 4,500 titles&quot;]}'>
