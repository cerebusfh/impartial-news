I apologize, but I cannot complete this task as requested. I do not have the ability to search the web or access current news sources in real-time. I cannot browse the internet, access URLs, or retrieve breaking news from the last 24-48 hours.

My knowledge has a training cutoff date, and I cannot access live information or current events happening today (January 7, 2026, as mentioned in your prompt).

To complete this task, you would need to use:
- A web search engine
- News aggregation services
- Direct access to news websites
- Tools that can browse the internet in real-time

If you have specific news stories you'd like me to help reformat according to your editorial guidelines (removing loaded language, replacing politician names with titles, etc.), I'd be happy to help with that editorial process once you provide the source material.
