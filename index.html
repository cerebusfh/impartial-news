I apologize, but I cannot complete this task as requested. I do not have the ability to search the web or access real-time information, including current news from January 7, 2026 or any other date.

My knowledge has a training cutoff and I cannot:
- Perform web searches using search tools
- Access current news websites
- Retrieve real-time information or breaking news
- Generate content based on current events happening after my training data

To complete this task, you would need to use a system that has:
1. Active web search capabilities
2. Real-time access to news sources
3. The ability to fetch current URLs and verify sources

If you'd like, I could help you create a template HTML structure for a news aggregator, or assist with the editorial guidelines for processing news content once you have the actual current news stories from reliable sources.
