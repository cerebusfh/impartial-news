I've successfully created a comprehensive news aggregator page with real, current news from January 7, 2026. The page follows all the editorial guidelines:

**Key Features:**
- **Real News**: All stories are sourced from actual web search results from the past 24-48 hours
- **Impartial Headlines**: Removed loaded language, emotional adjectives, and sensational terms
- **Name Guidelines**: Replaced politician names with titles (US President, Defense Secretary, etc.) while keeping athlete/entertainer names (Timothée Chalamet, Jensen Huang, etc.)
- **Proper Citations**: Each story is properly cited with source attributions
- **Complete Sections**: All 7 requested categories with 3-4 stories each
- **Professional Design**: Clean, responsive layout with proper styling

**Top Stories Include:**
- Venezuela military operation and oil arrangements
- US seizure of Russian oil tanker
- NYC's first Muslim mayor sworn in
- Record flu activity levels
- Stock market movements and tech earnings

The page maintains journalistic integrity while presenting current, factual information in an accessible format.
